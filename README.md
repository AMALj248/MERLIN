# Project MERLIN

It uses  Machine Learning  to predict and model covid-19 data , it is also Self Learning so the accuracy should increase after every subsequent run it uses data from SRK's Kaggle data , It Also Trcks it's model data and accuracy seperately on a CSV file and can also import pre trainded models from the Past if their Accuracy was high to avoid extra Training and if the Accuracy was Low it Automatically starts training a new model.

The Final version of the project is Based of Scikit Learns MLPRegressor, but i have also exprimented with Logistic Regression , Polynomial Models , Custom Models , Nural-Nets with parellel prossing in CPU and a few others with varying degree's of success.

To run it use MERLIN_CPU file with MERLIN_Tracker_CPU 

This project was able to rival a Similar Research Project with ~(60x) faster model training while accuracy was almost similar.

This was able to Plot and Train 6 seperate Models for Confirmed Cases , Recovered Cases , Death Cases for a user givev country & Globally all under 4 Min.

It was also acknowleged by one of the Authors of the above mentioned Research Paper in his Linkdin Post ->https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6686370290865336322/
